Hierarchical Models

Hierarchical Models Evaluator with a Open Inventor File Generator

Features
    This python script computes a hierarchical, robot like model (4-link, 3-joint robot).
    
    - Input: Parameter arguments in terminal
    - Output: A Open Inventor file with the generated hierarchical model.

Environment
    - Language: Python 3
    - OS: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
    - Interpreter: Python interpreter

Usage
    Running the Script
        1. Clone or download the script with example inputs into local machine
        2. Open terminal with directory containing the script
        3. Run the script with the following structure:
            ./CG_hw7 -t THETA1 -u THETA2 -v THETA3 -l LINK1 -m LINK2 -n LINK3

    Arguments
        - '-t THETA1': The rotation around the Z axis in world coodinates(Default is -51)
        - '-u THETA2': The rotation around the Y axis of Link 1's cooridnate system (Default is 39)
        - '-v THETA3': The rotation around the Y axis of Link 2's cooridnate system (Default is 65)
        - '-l LINK1': The origins of links coordinate system in the center of their bases, measured in Z direction (Default is 4)
        - '-m LINK2': The origins of links coordinate system in the center of their bases, measured in Z direction  (Default is 3)
        - '-n LINK3': The origins of links coordinate system in the center of their bases, measured in Z direction  (Default is 2.5)

    Output
        The script prints a standard out version of the Open Inventor file and can generate a separate Open Inventor file which is placed within the same directory as script.

Examples
    1. This command evaluates the hierarchical model using the default inputs. It will print to standard out:

        ./CG_hw7

    2. This command evaluates the hierarchical model with the default values for THETA1 and LINK2 but customized values for the rest of the arguments. The output will be saved to a file called 'my_model.iv':

        ./CG_hw7 -t -20 -m 4 > my_model.iv
